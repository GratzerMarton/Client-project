Requirements:
------------------
Clean coding 
HTML, Tailwind CSS, JS

Website theme: Information portal for products (specifically collectible action figures)

Note: The website will be turned into a marketplace eCommerce store (Note for layout), but not using any eCommerce properties. Like: cart, promotion, discount anything like that

Samples:
Data/content sample (idea for purpose and functionality): http://www.hottoysph.com/checklist/ 
One different functionality: Need to present dynamic show data, for the aftermarket buying/selling prices: Something like this: https://stockx.com/

Similar in style to https://stockx.com/ but without the eCommerce elements added in. 
The data for our site will be the same as you can find here: http://www.hottoysph.com/checklist/
