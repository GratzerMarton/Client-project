Pages:
--------
I have shared the Google Drive folder with you. In there you will find:
- Powerpoint with branding information (logo, color schemes, typography, etc)
- SVG file of our logo
- A sketch of the home page design (I am very much not confident in my design skills. I encourage you to use your artistic freedom)

The 5 pages that I want create are:
1) Home page with general welcome message and banner, search bar at the top. Featured items section to display cards below the welcome banner

2) Single product page (show information about the product, image gallery to scroll through, description of product and other key features, room at the bottom for data graphs)

3) Page to show all products in a certain category (similar to what can be found here https://www.hottoysph.com/checklist/category/movie-masterpiece-mms/)

4) Search results page with filtering (similar to what can be found here https://stockx.com/search/sneakers?s=air%20jordans)

5) General About us / Contact us page

Requirements:
------------------
Clean coding 
HTML, Tailwind CSS, JS

Website theme: Information portal for products (specifically collectible action figures)

Note: The website will be turned into a marketplace eCommerce store (Note for layout), but not using any eCommerce properties. Like: cart, promotion, discount anything like that

Samples:
Data/content sample (idea for purpose and functionality): http://www.hottoysph.com/checklist/ 
One different functionality: Need to present dynamic show data, for the aftermarket buying/selling prices: Something like this: https://stockx.com/

Similar in style to https://stockx.com/ but without the eCommerce elements added in. 
The data for our site will be the same as you can find here: http://www.hottoysph.com/checklist/

New Request:
============
Hey, I have one more revision and this will probably be the last one.

For the Navbar, I wanted the search icon to still be on the header, on the right side, opposite of the menu icon. 

The single product page picture should be a gallery that you can swipe through. With thumbnails beneath it. Something like can be seen here:

After these two changes, I will happily write an amazing review for you. And we would love to work with you again in the future if the need arises.
